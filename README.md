# JPEG-Compression

Implement the stages of JPEG compression based on the topics covered in the course. The implementation should include two functions, an encoder and a decoder, and a parameter that adjusts the degree of lossiness. Compare the size of the images before and after compression. Use these images as input. Include the results of applying your implementation to the images in the report.
